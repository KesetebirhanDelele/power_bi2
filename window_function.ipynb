    "\n",
    "1. TOPN covers some features of index. Ex: returning first row. But, index has added advantage of picking any rows: example 3rd row.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Of the three window functions, only Index has the capability to sort a table by columns when the table was created on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Index always returns unique values while TOPN can return two different rows with identical value.\n",
